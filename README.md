# Java-program-to-read-and-write-the-old-excel-file

This is Java Program read only the .xls file, If you need to modify the program for .xlsx file then change the XSSF to HSSF in every place in the program and change the file extension to .xlsx

The idea of this code is to get a user input value and enter it in the adjacent cell near the flag column, if the flag is set then the program will ask for an value from the user. That value will be updated in the excel sheet,

To execute this test case:
1. Download and install Java Development Kit (JDK), Java Runtime Envrionment (JRE) and Eclipse (or) anyother IDE for JAVA.
2. Open a New Java Project
3. Create a New class with the same name as Main class (In my case create the class name as ReadingExcel)
4. Copy my code and paste it in the editor.
5. Download Apache-POI-4.0.0 (.jar file)
6. Import in under the project folder in the Eclipse
7. After Importing right click on the POI jar file and Build path > add it to the path
8. Now change the location of the file in the folder accroding to the location of the file in you personal system
9. Run the code.
